This Python program implements a secure communication system with intrusion detection using Flask 
for a web interface, Flask-SocketIO for real-time logging, and various networking and cryptographic 
modules for security. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how this works:

step 1:Import Required Modules:
socket → Handles network communication.
threading → Enables multi-threading for running multiple tasks simultaneously.
os → Manages file operations (for encryption key storage).
scapy → Used for network packet sniffing and ARP spoof detection.
cryptography.fernet → Implements AES-based symmetric encryption.
Flask & Flask-SocketIO → Create a web interface and enable real-time updates.

step 2:Initialize Flask App & WebSocket
Creates a Flask web application.
SocketIO allows real-time communication between the server and the web interface.

step 3:Encryption Setup
Checks if an encryption key already exists (key.key).
If not, it generates a new key, saves it to a file, and loads it.
This key is used to encrypt and decrypt messages.

step 4:Encryption & Decryption Functions
encrypt_message() → Encrypts a plaintext message.
decrypt_message() → Decrypts an encrypted message, handling errors if decryption fails.

step 5:Secure Server Implementation
Creates a server socket bound to port 9999.
Listens for connections from clients.
Receives encrypted messages, decrypts them, and logs the details.
Sends back an acknowledgment message (also encrypted).

step 6:Secure Client Implementation
Connects to the server at port 9999.
Takes user input, encrypts it, and sends it to the server.
Receives an encrypted response, decrypts it, and logs the details.

step 7: Packet Sniffer Implementation
Sniffs 10 packets on the network.
Logs a summary of each captured packet.
Useful for detecting suspicious network activity.

step 8:ARP Spoof Detection(Address Resolution Protocol.)
Address Resolution Protocol:It is used to map an IP address within a local network (LAN).
Monitors ARP packets to detect spoofing attempts.
If an IP address sends conflicting ARP responses, it logs an alert.

127.0.0.1 is the loopback address, commonly known as localhost.

Key Points of about 127.0.0.1 IP:
It refers to the local machine (Our own computer).
Any network request sent to 127.0.0.1 never leaves Our device.
Used for testing servers and network applications locally.

step 9:HTML Web Interface
A web-based UI to start different services.
Uses Socket.IO for real-time updates.
Displays logs for server, client, sniffer, and ARP detector.

step 10:Flask Routes
Routes allow starting each function via the web interface.
Threading ensures they run in the background.
